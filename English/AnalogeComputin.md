# Analoge Computing 
In total a presentation of 10-15 min should be created.
## TODO:
1. Find structure   -> General structure found
1. Write paragraphs on each of the structure points 
2. Make presentation
3. Exercise
## Structure (0.5 min):
Made on the bases of the historical creation.  
0. Definition of analogue computers
1. Mechanical Analogue calculating devices
2. Specialised analogue computers
3. general purpose mechanical analogue computers
4. Electric analogue computers
5. Comparison of digital and analogue computers  

## Definition (1 min)
Should be it's own slide (too) and have a *visualisation*(**?**).  
This will be the entering point. After it the Historical part should start.
### Definition analogue computing
*Analog computer, any of a class of devices in which continuously variable physical quantities, such as electrical potential, fluid pressure, or mechanical motion, are represented in a way analogous to the corresponding quantities in the problem to be solved. The analog system is set up according to initial conditions and then allowed to change freely. Answers to the problem are obtained by measuring the variables in the analog model.*[From](https://www.britannica.com/technology/analog-computer)
### Definition digital computing
*Digital computer, any of a class of devices capable of solving problems by processing information in discrete form. It operates on data, including magnitudes, letters, and symbols [...]. By counting, comparing, and manipulating these digits or their combinations according to a set of instructions held in its memory, a digital computer can perform [...] tasks [...].*[From](https://www.britannica.com/technology/digital-computer)

## Mechanical analogue calculating devices (1-2 min)
The earliest analog calculators are astrolabes. This are devices, which mimic the movement of the planets in our solar system. The earliest such devices were found is 250 BC.  
Since then the creation of **slide roles** is the most important invention. These devices are made in three forms:
* Linear
* Circular
* Cylindrical

Thy are used to do simple mathematical calculations. *Examples are needed****!***  
Thy are still used to day in aviation.  

## Specialised analogue computers (1-2 min)
A lot of specialised analogue computers were produced in the military field. Therefor lots of these were created and optimised before and during the World-War's. 
There uses were:
* Controlling of Canons in 
    * Ships
    * Anti-aircraft guns
* Bomb dropping controllers
* Torpedo launch computers
* ...

Besides these analogue `computers` were and are used to test and model special circumstances like buildings or the flow of water in man made channels.
